# 🧱 LEGO Dataset Exploration

This project takes a deep dive into the history and evolution of the LEGO Group using a rich dataset compiled by Rebrickable. Through data analysis and interactive visualizations, we explore how LEGO sets have changed over time, which themes dominate, and how complexity has evolved.

---

## 📌 Objectives

We aim to answer several key questions through data-driven insights:

- 🧩 **What is the largest LEGO set ever released**, and how many parts does it include?
- 🏁 **When did LEGO start**, and how many sets were introduced in its earliest years?
- 🎭 **Which LEGO theme has the most sets** — original themes like *Ninjago*, or licensed ones like *Harry Potter* or *Marvel Super Heroes*?
- 📈 **How has LEGO's product line expanded over time?** Can we identify strategic shifts based on yearly trends in themes and sets?
- 🏗️ **Do LEGO sets show increasing complexity?** Have newer sets grown in size and piece count over the years?

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

The analysis was conducted using the following Python libraries:

- **pandas** – Data manipulation and transformation
- **numpy** – Numerical operations
- **matplotlib.pyplot** – Basic static plotting
- **seaborn** – Statistical data visualization
- **plotly.express** – Interactive and dynamic charts

These tools enabled both exploratory and presentational analysis with a blend of clarity and interactivity.
